## [Challenge #15 [difficult]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/q4dz1/2242012_challenge_15_difficult/)

Write a pair of programs that communicate with one another through socket connections. AKA a client-server connection.

Your server should be an echo server that simply echoes any information it receives back to the client.

For bonus points, your server should take a special command that will echo the subsequent information in reverse.

### Usage
Build with cargo.
Run both client and server with cargo run \<ip address> \<port>.
